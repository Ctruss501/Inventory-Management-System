# Inventory-Management-System
<h3> WGU Project, Java, JavaFX, IntelliJ </h3>
You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program. You have been provided with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and development of the system and a class diagram to assist you in your work. The organization also has specific business requirements that must be considered for the application. A systems analyst created the solution statements outlined in the requirements section of this task based on the business requirements. You will use these solution statements to develop your application.

- Designs software solutions with appropriate classes, objects, methods, and interfaces to achieve specific goals.

- Implements object-oriented design principles (e.g., inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction) in developing applications for ensuring the applicationâ€™s scalability.

- Produces applications using Java programming language constructs to meet business requirements.

- Incorporates simple exception handling in application development for improving user experience and application stability.

- Develops user interfaces to meet project requirements.
